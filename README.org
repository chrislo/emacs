* My emacs config

I've been an emacs user for nearly 25 years. Every so often I build a
new config from scratch, clear out some cruft and try a few new
packages or approaches.

This config reflects the fact that I mostly write code in Ruby and
JavaScript these days.

** Assumptions

- I use [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs+ 29]] compiled with treesitter mode
- I've installed the ~ruby-ts-mode~ and ~jtsx-jsx-mode~ using ~M-x
  treesit-install-language-grammar~
- I work on MacOS (at the time of writing v14)

** Inspiration

I love reading other people's configurations. This config is inspired
in particular by

- https://github.com/SophieBosio/.emacs.d
- https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs
- https://github.com/karthink/.emacs.d

but it also contains various snippets I've collected over the years
that either I've cobbled together, or I've borrowed from places
forgotten. Thank you to anyone who's ever shared their ~.emacs~!
